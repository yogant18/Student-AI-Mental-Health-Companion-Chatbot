## ðŸŒ± Project Description

Students often face high levels of **stress, anxiety,** and **loneliness**, yet hesitate to approach professional counselors.  
This AI-driven chatbot aims to fill that gap by:

- Detecting user mood through **sentiment analysis**,  
- Generating empathetic, motivational responses, and  
- Offering short **relaxation/mindfulness tips**â€“all in a safe conversational interface.

It is **not a replacement for therapy**, but a supportive companion.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Sentiment detection**: Uses TextBlob / optional HF pipeline to infer mood.  
- **Contextual replies**: Gemini generates responses based on prompt + mood.  
- **Relaxation tips**: Prompts include short guidance (breathing, grounding).  
- **Crisis keyword detection**: Recognizes phrases indicating self-harm or crisis and responds with care.  
- **Streamlit UI**: Clean, minimal interface for chat + settings (model, temperature, etc.).  
- **Modular architecture**: Separated config, AI client, sentiment utilities, and UI for clarity and ease of extension.
